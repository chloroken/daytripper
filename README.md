# INFO

Advantages:

	• Offline & open-source. Your data never leaves your PC.
	• Easy to use. No, really. Can you copy & paste? You're a black belt!
	• Daytripper colors site by purpose; a combat-relic site is more combat than relic.
	• Maps can be backed up and even shared with other users.

Disadvantages:

	• Not useful for group play due to offline nature.
	• Barebones, lack of features due to early stage of development.

Specifications:

    • Made with C# in Unity 2021.3.16f1.
    • Readable data structure: `MapFile.SolarSystem.CosmicSignature`.
    • Self-assembling scene philosophy.
